    "## What is Data Scraping\n",
    "Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the automated process of extracting large amounts of data from websites or other digital sources using software tools, scripts, or bots. This technique involves parsing the underlying HTML or structured data of web pages to collect specific information, such as prices, contact details, or user reviews, which can then be stored in databases, spreadsheets, or used for analysis. While it enables efficient data gathering for purposes like market research, competitive analysis, or machine learning training, data scraping must comply with legal and ethical guidelines, as it can violate terms of service, infringe on copyrights, or overload servers if not done responsibly."

    "## Core Concept\n",
    "- HTML: The main markup language for web structure\n",
    "- CSS: Used for styling, but crucial for selectors (e.g., .class or #id) when selecting specific elements on a page\n",
    "- JS (JavaScript): Many modern sites load data dynamically via JS (AJAX)\n",
    "- API: Application programming interface\n",
    "- Cookies: Session tokens for authentication or tracking\n",
    "- Sitemap: An XML file that lists all pages on a site\n",
    "\n",
    "More Advanced Concepts:\n",
    "- CAPTCHA: A challenge-response test (e.g., image recognition or puzzles) designed to distinguish humans from bots\n",
    "- Honeypots: Hidden traps on websites, like invisible form fields that bots might fill out but humans won't see\n",
    "- Proxies and IP Rotation: Using a pool of proxy servers to switch IP addresses randomly, which helps avoid rate limiting, bans, or detection when making repeated requests.\n",
    "- GraphQL: A more flexible API variation"
